-- 2014-10-25 ND: add minor filtering, new device support.

-- =========================
-- ABSTRACT
-- =========================
-- dump_clean and its SQL query, dump_clean.sql, perform a filtered dump of the measurements table per user request.
--
-- The filtering is the same as that used by the iOS app.
--
-- This differs from dump_measurements, which does not filter data at all.
-- The schema returned is also different; redundant/unused columns have been eliminated, and id/user_id finally included.
-- The ORDER BY clause was removed for performance.
--

-- todo: test if this can be multiline, it's difficult to read and maintain in this form
