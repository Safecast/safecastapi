# Performs a filtered dump of the measurements table.
#
# The filtering is the same as that used by the iOS app.
#
# This differs from dump_measurements, which does not filter data at all.
# The schema returned is also different; redundant/unused columns have been eliminated, and id/user_id finally included.
# The ORDER BY clause was removed for performance.
