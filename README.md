The app that powers [api.safecast.org](https://api.safecast.org/)

## Overview

This is a rails app deployed in front of Postgres with Postgis. Data files generatated from various devices such as the [bGeigie Nano](http://nano.safecast.org) and are uploaded to the production app at api.safecast.org.

From there applications query the app's endpoints to pull the stored data for other purposes.

See the [Tilemap](https://github.com/Safecast/Tilemap/) Project's README for more diagrams on the complete data flow.

There is also a development host located at [dev.safecast.org](https://dev.safecast.org) which is used for testing features before rolling them to the main endpoint.
